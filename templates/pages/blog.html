                    <p>Around 35% of adults in the US and 37% of adults in Asia reported sleeping less than 7 hours per night.</p>
                    <p>In this day and age, almost all of us are regularly sleep-deprived. A healthy adult requires 7-9 hours of sleep, but a majority of people only get 5-6 hours of sleep. It's really important that you get enough sleep for your age. See the Table below:</p>

                    <h2>Why do we need good sleep?</h2>
                    <p>Good sleep boosts your physical and athletic performance by repairing damaged muscles, tissues, and blood vessels. With proper and good sleep you are more likely to be calm, satisfied, happy, and stress-free most of the time. Often people think that during sleep our brain is resting but it's not quite true when sleeping our brain prepares us for the next day for activities like creation, thinking, learning, remembering, etc. Thus, increasing our overall physical and mental health.</p>
                    <p>Lack of sleep can cause various issues like type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and a lot more.</p>
                    <p>Having a good sleep won't only minimize the risks of certain diseases but also boosts your immunity which will protect you from other diseases that are not directly related to lack of sleep.</p>
                    <p>Sleep deprivation increases amygdala activity( Amygdala processes threatful stimuli and generally triggers emotions like fear and anger ), which results in less social interest because now your brain might interpret other people as a threat. Not having a good sleep also makes you more emotionally volatile, short-tempered, and irritable as well.</p>
                    <p>With only a few of the possible problems and benefits listed above letâ€™s see how can you achieve good sleep at night.</p>

                                    <h3>Follow a sleep schedule:</h3>
                                    <p>Following a sleep schedule means sleeping and waking up at the same time every day. By doing this your body will maintain the circadian rhythm also called the body's internal clock, which regulates the alertness and sleepiness of your brain. Following a sleep schedule will give you good quality and quantity of sleep.</p>

                                    <p>Physical activities reduce sleep onset ( Sleep onset is the time duration taken to go from wakefulness to sleep). Physical activities also reduce daytime sleepiness. Don't exercise before bed because it will make your body very active, and increase your heart rate but to get good sleep you need to be relaxed.</p>

                                    <p>Make sure your bedroom is dark and silent. It is much easier to fall asleep in a colder environment rather than in a hot and warm environment. Keep your bed clean and tidy, also if try to use a soft mattress, pillow, and blanket. By doing all of these changes in your bedroom either you will either increase your quantity of sleep or quality of sleep or both.</p>

                                    <p>Caffeine has a half-life of 5 hours which means every five hours the amount of caffeine you have in your body will reduce to half, let's say you took 80mg of caffeine at 2 pm after 5 hours i.e 7 pm your body will still have 40mg of caffeine, and similarly at 12 am your body will still have 20mg of caffeine left in your body.</p>
                                    <p>And we all know having caffeine in your body when trying to sleep won't help, but the results will be quite opposite. So, do a little maths and decide for yourself at what time and how much caffeine are you consuming.</p>

                                    <p>To fall asleep your body needs to be relaxed, but by eating before bed you disrupt your circadian rhythm. <br> When your body is expecting to be relaxed to make you fall asleep, by eating food you give it the task to digest it, and now your body is trying to digest it rather than relaxing and sleeping which in turn confuses your bodyâ€™s internal clock.</p>

                                    <p>So, if you can't fall asleep within 15-20 minutes after getting into bed you should get out of bed and read a book. Don't turn on any other light than a reading lamp, because other lights will trick your brain into that it's still day and it will become more difficult for you to get a good sleep. Only go to bed when you feel sleepy, not tired.</p>

                                    <h4>We all know that in a dark you will sleep better, but why? </h4>
                                    <p>Well, darkness produces melatonin in your brain which puts you in a state of quiet wakefulness, which in turn promotes better sleep. <br> In response to light, your brain doesn't produce melatonin, but in dark it does. So by using electronic devices at night you give a signal to your brain that itâ€™s still day and your brain does not produce melatonin. Therefore it disturbs your circadian rhythm.</p>
