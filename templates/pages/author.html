        <p>I am a blogger currently studying in Class 11th. I write articles related to technology, health and productivity. The most interesting thing I found in blogging is that we gains as well as share knowledge. Like, before writing on a topic, we have to do a lot of research and then we have to make our own points and then have to start writing on that topic. In this way, we are gaining as well as sharing knowledge.</p>
        <p>Most of the people see only blogging as a source of making money online.  But due to this we forget that by blogging we are absorbing a lot of knowledge as well as sharing it with the people who are searching for it.</p>
        <p>Currently I am learning a lot about of things related to digital marketing and want to make a career in this field. I hope that you like to read my articles.</p>
