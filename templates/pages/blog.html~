                    <h2>What is stress?</h2>
                    <p>Stress is the situation when a person thinks a lot about something continuously like stress for exam or exam result, financial problems, personal problems, health problems etc. It makes us feel angry, frustrated and nervous.</p>
					<br>
					<p>According to Wikipedia, in psychology, stress means feeling of emotional stress and pressure. Stress can be classified as short-term stress and long-term stress. Stress is not always bad if it makes us to take better steps and decisions but it is bad if your stress does not results in something useful.</p>
					<p>For example, if you are taking stress for your exams and after thinking a lot about your exams you started studying but in the other case, you are just taking a lot of stress and not taking any action. In the first case, stress is good because it made you to take a valuable action but in the second case, stress is bad because it only make you to over think.</p>
